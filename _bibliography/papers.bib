ABSTRACT = {Heart failure is a class of cardiovascular diseases that remains the number one cause of death worldwide with a substantial economic burden of around $18 billion incurred by the healthcare sector in 2017 due to heart failure hospitalization and disease management. Although several laboratory tests have been used for early detection of heart failure, these traditional diagnostic methods still fail to effectively guide clinical decisions, prognosis, and therapy in a timely and cost-effective manner. Recent advances in the design and development of biosensors coupled with the discovery of new clinically relevant cardiac biomarkers are paving the way for breakthroughs in heart failure management. Natriuretic neurohormone peptides, B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and N-terminal prohormone of BNP (NT-proBNP), are among the most promising biomarkers for clinical use. Remarkably, they result in an increased diagnostic accuracy of around 80% owing to the strong correlation between their circulating concentrations and different heart failure events. The latter has encouraged research towards developing and optimizing BNP biosensors for rapid and highly sensitive detection in the scope of point-of-care testing. This review sheds light on the advances in BNP and NT-proBNP sensing technologies for point-of-care (POC) applications and highlights the challenges of potential integration of these technologies in the clinic. Optical and electrochemical immunosensors are currently used for BNP sensing. The performance metrics of these biosensors&mdash;expressed in terms of sensitivity, selectivity, reproducibility, and other criteria&mdash;are compared to those of traditional diagnostic techniques, and the clinical applicability of these biosensors is assessed for their potential integration in point-of-care diagnostic platforms.},
