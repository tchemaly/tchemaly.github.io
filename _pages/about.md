 I am a Bioengineering PhD Candidate at Stanford University, highly motivated by impact, and passionate about innovation.
 
 Advised by Prof. Brian Hargreaves and Dr. Nikolas Blevins, my research focus is augmented reality for head and neck surgery. I am fortunate to collaborate with multiple Stanford groups including the [Surgical Simulation lab](https://med.stanford.edu/cardinalsim.html), the [Incubator for Medical Mixed and Extended Reality at Stanford (IMMERS)](https://med.stanford.edu/immers.html) , the [Visualization Lab](https://neuroscience.stanford.edu/shared-resources/visualization-lab), the [Body Magnetic Resonance (BMR) Group](https://med.stanford.edu/bmrgroup.html), and the [Salisbury Robotics Lab](https://sr.stanford.edu/?page_id=1217).

I am proudly the co-president of [Stanford XR](https://www.stanfordxr.org/), Stanford University's student organization for extended reality. We work on building a community that encourages engagement, creates access, and supports innovation in the extended reality space.

From 2017 to 2019, I followed the Master program in Biomedical Engineering at the American University of Beirut. During this period, I was a Research Assistant at the [Neural Engineering and Nanobiosensors Group](https://sites.aub.edu.lb/samneuro/), where I worked on neural interfaces and restoring vision with electrical stimulation.

In 2017, I received my degree in Biomedical Engineering from the Holy Spirit University of Kaslik (USEK). I completed my thesis in collaboration with the [Robotics and Mechatronics](https://www.ram.eemcs.utwente.nl/) group at the University of Twente, the Netherlands.
